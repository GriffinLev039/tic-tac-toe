Objects: 
 - User
   > Instance variables of name, input (e.g. x, o), score
 - Board?

Modules:
 - Game logic?
   > Board is a private variable
   > detects win via private function
   > Only callable functions are setPos, resetGame probably?
   > MAYBE have a getter for gameBoard
 - Display
   > One public function, displayGame()
   > Takes argument of game, which refers to IIFE for gameboard

Idea is:
 > Central gameboard object
 > Game logic IIFE
 > Display IIFE
 > Objects to represent users

 If i just want a gameboard, with a function to set stuff, a function to reset the board, and a function to read the board, I just want an IIFE. 

How displayLogic will work:



idea for how program could run:
	Game logic intialized
	Creates gameboard
	passes gameboard to display
	creates two users
	runs game

idea for how program could run:
	intialize gameboard IIFE
	display logic gets gameboard, displays it
	on every move, coordinates are passed from gameboard to displayLogic, updates display

displayController

gameController
